"""The trading desk as the workspace sees it: the day's record and what changed.

Every field comes from the JSON records `market_daily` writes under the
market data root, so the page cannot show a grade, a weight or a flag the
desk did not write. The user path segment keeps the same authorization as
every other per-user route; the records themselves are the operator's own.
